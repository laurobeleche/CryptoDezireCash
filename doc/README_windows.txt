Crypto Dezire Cash Core
=====================

Intro
-----
Crypto Dezire Cash is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run cryptodezirecash-qt.exe.

Crypto Dezire Cash Core is the original Crypto Dezire Cash client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Crypto Dezire Cash transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
